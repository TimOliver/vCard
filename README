TimOliver.id.au vCard Source Code
By Timothy 'TiM' Oliver

***********************************************

Since there was a little bit of interest in how
it was put together, here is the source code
for my online vCard (http://TimOliver.id.au/) 
and all of the assets in its entirety.

It's coded entirely in PHP and is targeted at
HTML5/CSS3.

***********************************************

Some portions of the code are under MIT license,
but for the rest of the code, feel free to use
it where-ever (attribution would be appreciated,
but isn't required.)
